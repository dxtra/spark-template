Spark project template

You will need the spark-repl jar that is not included in this repo. To generate
the jar, do:

    $ git clone git@github.com:mesos/spark.git
    $ cd spark
    $ sbt/sbt assembly

Copy the spark-repl jar to lib directory.


Run the example with:

    $ ./run examples.SparkPi local 10


I've also included the sbt eclipse plugin with this. You can generate Eclipse
project files with

    $ sbt/sbt eclipse

Then you can debug your project in Eclipse.


Have fun programming Spark!
